## Development setup

This repository features a NixOS flake, which may be used to set up the needed things like pre-commit hooks and checks, as well as needed utilities, automatically via [direnv](https://direnv.net/).
Needed are `nix` (the package manager) and [direnv](https://direnv.net/), after that, the environment may be entered by running `direnv allow`.
